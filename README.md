# Goals for this project

- To practice teamwork
- To create a full-stack-app with the given features in a given time
- To learn the server-sent events
- To practice disciplined git usage with correct branching

# Server Sent Events

In this project, we are allowing multiple game rooms to be streamed simultaneusly through the user of server sent events (json-sse).

The project initializes an object which populates stream data for each game room. Each stream data is an object that contains an array of clients (user ids) and a stream object. Stream datas are indexed by game id and they are dynamically created when a new game room is created.
